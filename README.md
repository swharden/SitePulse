# SitePulse

**SitePulse is a privacy focused website analytics platform used for analyzing web page visit and state information without logging details about individual users.** SitePulse uses an ASP.NET Core minimal API to respond to requests to tracking pixels. Page and state information is encoded in the filename of the requested image, and unique clients are identified by their IP address and anonymized using a partial MD5 hashing function which stores a user ID as a string which cannot be used to derive the original IP address. A PHP implementation is explored in this repository as well. Using tracking pixels instead of JavaScript fetch endpoints takes advantage of client-side caching and minimizes HTTP requests.
